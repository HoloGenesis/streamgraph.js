Streamgraph.js is a port of Lee Byron and Martin Wattenberg's streamgraph_generator to javascript.
Here's the original project: http://github.com/leebyron/streamgraph_generator

The paper "Stacked Graphs -- Geometry & Aesthetics" by Byron &  Wattenberg is useful to consult.

Onsets are just where data is first > 0.
