1) Make page a huge canvas, because CSS layout sucks. (DONE)
2) Each example will just be a javascript file full of data
3) streamgraph.pjs will be able to accept and display that data.
4) Since standalone page is simple, each example will have its own html file (but no other files, other than data)

Make 3 examples:
1) EN Audio
2) EN Hotttnesss
3) Stream data, LTER,

    no3_uM, Nitrate 
    po4_uM, SKIP
    tdn_uM, Total Dissolved Nitrogen (Substract Ammonia and Nitrate, what's left will be Other: "Organic Nitrogen")
    tdp_uM, SKIP
    tpc_uM, SKIP
    tpn_uM, Interesting (if present, looks like all -999.0)
