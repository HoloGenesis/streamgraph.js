FEATURES:
    Fixed colors        PUNT (can't seed Math.Random)    
    Title               PUNT (can't center without some text knowledge)
    Save PNG            PUNT (save not currently implemented in 0.8)

BUGS:
    Chrome on Mac ...   PUNT (hopefully this will eventually get fixed in processing/chrome?)

BEFORE PUBLICATION:
    GET CODE REVIEWED.
        Stop calling computeLayerSize from graphVertex.
        Globals?
        Stop passing lastFmColors all the time.
    
    Make 3 examples:
    1) EN Audio
    2) EN Hotttnesss
    3) Stream data, LTER, 
        http://sbc.lternet.edu/external/Land/Data/Stream_Chemistry/stream_chemistry_allyears.txt
        site_code,  Pick two sites (FK01 - Franklin Creek, CA; AH01 - Arroyo Hondo, CA)
        timestamp_local, (more dense sampling when there is a storm, try to get same storm.)
        nh4_uM, Ammonia
        no3_uM, Nitrate 
        po4_uM, SKIP
        tdn_uM, Total Dissolved Nitrogen (Substract Ammonia and Nitrate, what's left will be Other: "Organic Nitrogen")
        tdp_uM, SKIP
        tpc_uM, SKIP
        tpn_uM, Interesting (if present, looks like all -999.0)
        tpp_uM, SKIP
        tss_mgperLiter, SKIP
        spec_cond_uSpercm SKIP?
        Look at just a storm. Possibly also all 10 years.

    4) Git Hub data, Google Reader, Gov Data, Mortality Data

    Write up the examples:
    1) How to use
    2) Pretty pictures.

    Blog them somewhere
    Running with Data?
