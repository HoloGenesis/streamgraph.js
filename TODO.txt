FEATURES:
    Title               PUNT (can't center without some text knowledge)
    Save PNG            PUNT (save not currently implemented in 0.8)
    Data
        don't require it to be aligned (do the alignment)
        x-labels
    Change Settings
        don't make users edit streamgraph.settings.js?
        make an example with a custom colorizer.
    Highlight           PUNT (Need fixed colors first)
    
BUGS:
    Chrome on Mac ...   PUNT (hopefully this will eventually get fixed in processing/chrome?)
    Non-Zero-looking data with hover text of 0. This is due to interpolation.
    Sparse data (layers with very few points) doesn't get displayed nicely. (This is shared with the original implementation)

BEFORE PUBLICATION:
    GET CODE REVIEWED.
        Stop calling computeLayerSize from graphVertex.
        Globals?
        Stop passing lastFmColors all the time.
    
    Make 3 examples:
        http://measuringmeasures.com/blog/2010/4/29/datasets-and-data-driven-startups.html
    1) EN Audio
        Glenn Gould Aria
        cumulative pitch is boring.
    2) EN Hotttnesss
        resample
        scale with logs
    3) Stream data, LTER, 
        http://sbc.lternet.edu/external/Land/Data/Stream_Chemistry/stream_chemistry_allyears.txt
        site_code,  Pick two sites (FK01 - Franklin Creek, CA; AH01 - Arroyo Hondo, CA)
        timestamp_local, (more dense sampling when there is a storm, try to get same storm.)
        nh4_uM, Ammonia
        no3_uM, Nitrate 
        po4_uM, SKIP
        tdn_uM, Total Dissolved Nitrogen (Subtract Ammonia and Nitrate, what's left will be Other: "Organic Nitrogen")
        tdp_uM, SKIP
        tpc_uM, SKIP
        tpn_uM, Interesting (if present, looks like all -999.0)
        tpp_uM, SKIP
        tss_mgperLiter, SKIP
        spec_cond_uSpercm SKIP?
        Look at just a storm. 
            boring
        Possibly also all 10 years.
    4) last.fm history
        Need non-sparse data.
    4) Git Hub data, Google Reader, Gov Data, Mortality Data

    Write up the examples:
    1) How to use
    2) Pretty pictures.

    Blog them somewhere
    Running with Data?
