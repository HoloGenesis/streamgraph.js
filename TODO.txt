get standalone page working.
1) Make page a huge canvas, because CSS layout sucks. (DONE)
2) Each example will just be a javascript file full of data
3) streamgraph.pjs will be able to accept and display that data.
4) Since standalone page is simple, each example will have its own html file (but no other files, other than data)

Make 3 examples:
1) EN Audio
2) EN Hotttnesss
3) Stream data, LTER, 
4) Git Hub data, Google Reader, Gov Data, Mortality Data

Write up the examples:
1) How to use
2) Pretty pictures.

Blog them somewhere
